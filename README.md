This is a silly family game. Click ‘How to play’ on the start page to see instructions.

Deployed as a static app using Dokku PaaS, running on Google Cloud VM.

See it in action: https://sara-treasure-hunt.herokuapp.com **Note:** it may take 10-15 seconds to lad first time, that is normal. Heroku free apps go to sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity.
